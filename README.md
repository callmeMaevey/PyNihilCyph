# PyNihilCyph
Simple Nihilst cypher written in python, based on the wikipidea entry

You will need a .txt file with ascii characters in a square (utf-8) (ignores spaces)

download the example, "square.txt" (its from wikipidea) or make your own!

to run you will need python... but its a single file
ðŸ’• run main.py to get cryptic ðŸ’•
